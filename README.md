# Preliminary Analyses of a Visual Search Task in Older vs. Younger Adults

This public repository contains preliminary analyses from a Visual Search Task conducted with two distinct samples: older adults and younger adults.

This research project was conceptualized by Alexandria Holcomb, who, during her time as a PhD student at the APA lab, also collected and analysed the data.
For the purpose of this final project assignment, the data has been randomly generated in alignment with the study’s hypotheses to reflect the expected outcomes.

# Aims

In the context of aging, deficits in visual working memory and attention are commonly observed in older adults, two cognitive functions that are closely related. These deficits tend to be minimal when tasks are less demanding, due to compensatory mechanisms such as recruiting additional cognitive resources. However, this compensation becomes inefficient as task demands increase.

Using a visual search task, a behavioral measure of attention where participants must find a target item among distractors and indicate whether the target is present or absent, this project aims to explore how the set size (the total number of items displayed) and also the visual characteristics of the stimuli may influence older adults’ performance. 

# Behavioral Task

In this particular behavioral task:
- The difficulty of the visual search was manipulated according to set size and stimuli similarity in the following ways (in interaction):
  - Set size varied across three levels, with 5, 7, or 10 stimuli displayed;
  - Stimuli similarity varied across three levels:
    - Baseline: Stimuli could belong to any conceptual category (e.g., clothing, forniture, ...) and any color category (e.g., blue, brown, ...);
    - High Conceptual Similarity: Stimuli were restricted to a single conceptual category but could be of different colors;
    - High Color Similarity: Stimuli were restricted to a single color but could belong to different conceptual categories.
- The target item could either be present or absent in the display.

Both Reaction Time (RT) and accuracy were measured in the task.
